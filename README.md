# Data Manipulation with JavaScript
A few small activities to familiarize myself with data manipulation and processing using JavaScript. By becoming more familiar with the logic behind programming decisions, I will be able to create more efficient solutions in the future.
# Objectives
- Create variable declarations using both let and const.
- Apply different types of data literals.
- Use arithmetic operators to manipulate data.
- Use comparison operators to compare data.
- Perform string concatenations.
- Implement escape sequences in strings for special characters.
- Use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
- Create effective documentation through the use of comments.
